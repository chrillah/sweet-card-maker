# Name 
Sweet Card Maker

# Brief Project Description 
This SPA is created in Vue.js with Vite. It is a final project for the JavaScript Frameworks course in frontend development at ITHS.

# Description 
The purpose of the app is to showcase skills in the JavaScript framework, Vue.js, for the JavaScript Frameworks course. Using a JSON file, the app retrieves information, and depending on the information, the components are rendered. The idea for the app came after finding beautiful images on Unsplash and listening to Wu Tang Clan. The app has a page with a collection of pre-made cards, a page where you can create cards with a short text, and a page where you can save the cards you've made. The cards are saved in local storage. Someday, I would like to further develop the app to add features like being able to share these cards with others.
